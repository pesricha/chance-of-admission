When it comes to applying to master's programs, prospective graduate students are constantly faced with a conundrum when picking which universities to attend. While there are many predictors and consultancies that can help a student, they aren't always accurate because admissions decisions are based on a small number of historical admissions. Given the student's profile, we propose a Machine Learning-based method that compares various machine learning algorithms, such as Linear Regression and Support Vector Machines. The error functions for the various models are then computed, and their performance is compared to determine which model is the best performer. The results show whether the chosen university is a risky or a safe bet.
